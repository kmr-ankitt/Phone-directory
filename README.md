# Phone Directory Project

This project implements a phone directory using a doubly linked list data structure. It allows users to add, delete, search for, and display contacts efficiently. The doubly linked list ensures fast insertion, deletion, and traversal operations, making it suitable for managing a directory of contacts.

## Features

- Add new contacts with names and phone numbers.
- Delete contacts by name.
- Search for contacts by name.
- Display the entire phone directory in alphabetical order.
